•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
 The ABCU project's problem was storing the course information into a preferable data structure, printing all the course information in alphanumeric       order, searching for a specific course, and printing out the information. 
  
•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
There are different data structures that can be used to solve the problem: vector, hash table, and binary search tree. Each data structures have its advantages and disadvantages. For this particular project, I chose the hash table because the time complexity of the hash table for search and insertion is O(1).  
By understanding the data structures and their algorithms, I will be able to analyze the time/memory complexity to implement a program in the most efficient way to meet the requirement.

•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
 I didn’t have any significant roadblocks because by designing each data structure pseudocode for the ABCU project each week.  I had to spend enormous time planning the logical step by step for the project before coding it. Writing the pseudocode was a struggle, but it made the actual coding so much easier. The rest of it is just debugging and fixing minor issues.

•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
 Learning the different types of data structures, it had helped me to have a better understanding of its algorithms and their time/memory complexity.  There are many ways of approaching/solving problems. By analyzing each data structure and depending on the project requirement, the programmer can determine which data structures will work the best base on their functionalities, memory capacity, and time complexity.

•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 My goal is always to design projects that are easy to maintain and readable. After taking this course, I have improved my analysis skills to calculate  the structure’s time complexity to determine the best efficient algorithm.
